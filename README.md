Okay, let's tackle generating the README for the '97. Train Alarm System' project. The user wants a meaningful title within 50 characters. Looking at the code, it uses ultrasonic sensors and LEDs with different distance thresholds. So maybe something like "Train Proximity Alert System with Multi-Stage LED Indicators" â€“ that's under 50 characters.

Next, the description. I need to detail what the project does based on the code. The system uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect distance, and as the train gets closer, more LEDs light up. Each LED has a different threshold. I should mention the components involved: Arduino, HC-SR04, LEDs. Also, the purpose is safety and preventing accidents by visual alerts.

The user specified not to include contribution or license info, so skip those sections. Include a pin mapping section based on the code. The trigPin is 2, echoPin 3, and the LEDs are on A4
